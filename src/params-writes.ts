/**
 * Write channels for the params maintenance UI (S3 of
 * docs/designs/param-management-ui.md). Two classes of write, each with its
 * persistence owner:
 *
 * - Config edits go through the HOST config editor
 *   (`ctx.configEditor.edit()`): the host writes the merged config into the
 *   profile patch under a file lock, runs Loader reconciliation, and the
 *   plugin re-composes with the new config — persistence, conflict
 *   detection, and reload stay the host's job. (The settings FORM service
 *   was the first choice but projects only `.volatile()` schema fields,
 *   whose value semantics would infect every config read here; the editor's
 *   entry-level edit keeps plain config values.)
 * - Pack-param default edits rewrite the pack's manifest.json directly
 *   (packs are not profile entries — the host has no channel for them).
 *   The proposed manifest must pass the exact load-time validation before
 *   it touches disk, the write is atomic, and the loaded pack map is
 *   hot-swapped IN PLACE (clear + re-fill of the same Map instance the
 *   tools hold) so the next doc_generate sees the new default without a
 *   restart. A concurrent generation keeps its old Pack object and finishes
 *   under the spec it started with — the swap only affects new calls.
