# Authoring docwright packs

You are authoring a **docwright pack**: the complete quality contract for one
class of documents, executed by the docwright plugin for deepseek-harness.
A pack = five aligned contracts plus proof that green is reachable:

| asset | declares | enforced |
|---|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | identity, params, scope, chaining | load time (fail loud) |
| `schema.json` | what the document looks like (structure) | every validation (ajv) |
| `rules/<lang>.json` | what "qualified" means (simple families) | every validation |
| `rules/functions.js` | cross-field / cross-artifact rules (optional) | every validation |
| `prompts/<lang>.md` | how to generate | every generation round |
| `templates/<lang>.hbs` | how to render Markdown | every generation |
| `samples/golden.json` | proof that a compliant document exists | `pack:check`, tests |
| `samples/golden.params.json` | param values for golden validation (optional) | `pack:check` only |

The engine gives you for free: the closed repair loop (generate → validate →
fix, with convergence detection and budgets), replayable receipts, the
confirmation gate for params, chain verification of upstream green artifacts,
fan-out addressing, artifact reuse, and Markdown rendering. **The engine never
learns your domain** — everything domain-specific lives in the pack.

Live examples ship beside this guide: the built-in `cosmic-*` packs (a
five-stage COSMIC estimation chain plus a context-sync pack). Read one while
you work; they demonstrate every rule below.

Rule of thumb for every asset you write: **schema says what the document looks
like, rules say what counts as qualified, the prompt mirrors the rules.**
Prompt constraints the rules do not check = decorative guardrails. Rules the
prompt never mentions = blind repair loops.

## Where packs live (write path)

Two lanes; pick explicitly before writing files:

- **Repository lane** (built-in / scenario packs): work in a checkout of the
  docwright repository, packs under `packs/<name>/`. This is the only lane
  where the full test suite (mutation tests, deterministic loop tests, host
  smoke) can run. Merge via feature branch.
- **packsDir lane** (custom packs): the `packsDir` config entry is the only
  install point that does not touch the repository. Convention:
  `<workspace>/.docwright/packs/` (absolute path in cordis.yml). A same-name
  pack there overrides the built-in one. If the directory is inside the
  session workspace you can write it with normal file tools; if outside, ask
  the user to place files or approve the write.

**Loading happens at plugin apply time**: after writing or changing pack
files, the plugin must reload (host restart/reload) before `doc_generate` sees
them. A pack you just authored is never usable in the same session that wrote
it — verify with `pack:check` instead.

## Verify as you go

Run the checker after every asset you complete — never batch to the end:

```sh
pnpm run pack:check -- <dir>                # from a docwright repository checkout
pnpm run pack:check -- <dir> --with packs   # your pack consumes packs that live in another root (e.g. the built-in packs/)
```

It runs the real loader gate (manifest, param invariants, regex compilability,
prompt slot presence, language coverage) and then validates every pack's
golden sample per language through the real schema + rules, printing a health
sheet (rule inventory, severity distribution, param table). Exit 0 = green.
Any red means fix now: the message carries the rule id and the fix hint.

Golden validation with required-no-default params: if your rules read a
required param that has no default (e.g. a budget only the user can state),
function rules skip when it is absent, but declarative references fail loud.
Ship `samples/golden.params.json` (a JSON object of `{ paramName: value }`) to
supply values for the golden run only.

## The nine stages

Stages 0-2 and 4-5 are design; 3, 6, 7 produce executable assets; 8-9 are
acceptance. Iterate freely between design and development — never skip
acceptance.

### Stage 0 — Know the domain

Answer in writing: what documents does this scenario produce, what is the
business flow, who does what at each step? Produce a one-paragraph domain
model (each stage of the flow = one sentence defining its core object) and a
problem statement (what is unguarded today).

Hard contract: domain concepts live ONLY in packs, never in the plugin.

### Stage 1 — Plan the artifacts

List the documents. For each answer: docType name, granularity, reference
relations to other artifacts.

- Granularity: if the count grows linearly with a work object (one output per
  entry of an upstream array — per function, per clause, per requirement), it
  is fan-out granularity. If globally unique (project context, overall plan),
  it is a single artifact.
- Reusability: an artifact reused across work items (project architecture,
  glossary) becomes its own pack, workspace-scoped, `reuse: true` — **a
  reusable output is a pack, not a material** (artifacts are validated,
  anchored, and seal-correctable; materials are not). Knowledge consumed once
  is a material.

### Stage 2 — Design schemas and object relations

One `schema.json` (draft-07 or 2020-12) per artifact: fields, types, enums,
nesting, and the reference keys that anchor artifacts to each other (cosmic
anchors on `funcId`).

- Layering: **schema = structural legality (static); rules = policy
  (param-driven)**. The schema expresses the structural ceiling (context's
  three-level tree is inlined); the actual depth is a param checked by a
  function rule. Closed value sets are schema enums; unconditional
  requirements are schema `required`.
- Nesting boundary: declarative rule paths support only `$` and
  `$.field[*]` (one level). Two-plus nesting (tech's subProcesses) goes to
  function rules — foresee this while designing the schema.
- Omit prototype-era metadata fields (timestamps, human-review flags) unless
  they have generation or validation semantics.

### Stage 3 — Design and develop the rules

Translate domain quality standards into a rule set. Prefer, in order:
schema-expressible (do not write a rule) → declarative families
(`minLength` / `maxLength` / `forbiddenKeywords` / `pattern`) → function rules
(`rules/functions.js`) for cross-field, cross-artifact, nested-scope, or
param-driven checks.

- Severity: `error` = must block (structural breakage, anchor mismatch,
  budget violation, uniqueness conflicts); `warning` = quality flaw (verbose
  descriptions, caution words); `info` = style advice. Be frugal: one
  parameterized rule can subsume a family of ad-hoc rules.
- **Every rule carries a `suggestion` written as a fix instruction**, not a
  problem description — it feeds the repair loop's prompt.
- Every rule must be mutation-testable: if you cannot construct a broken
  sample the rule must catch, the rule is decorative — drop or redesign it.
- Parameterize bounds and regex sources with `{ "param": "<name>" }` when the
  threshold is a deployment preference rather than a domain constant.
  Declared regex params: empty string = check off; non-empty must compile
  (checked at load time).
- Cross-artifact rules: function rules receive `context.upstream` (parsed
  upstream artifacts). If a consumed upstream is missing or of the wrong
  type, fail loud — never skip silently.

**Function-rule programming contract**: `rules/functions.js` is a plain
Node-loadable ESM JavaScript module — no build step, no TypeScript, no npm
dependencies, **no `import` statements** (inline your helpers). Export a
`rules` array; each entry `{ id, severity (default "error"), suggestion,
check(artifact, context?) }`; `check` returns `RuleIssue[]`
(`{ jsonPath, message, snapshot? }`; empty array = pass). Rules MUST be pure
and deterministic (output depends only on artifact and context — no I/O, no
clock, no randomness): the engine snapshots the file's sha256 into receipts,
so re-validation must reproduce the verdict. Convention: rule ids are namespaced
`<short-name>/<slug>` (e.g. `plan/cfp-total-band`).

**Scoring — the unified model, for free**: convergence scoring defaults to a
built-in severity deduction — `100 − 10×error − 3×warning − 1×info`, clamped
to 0-100. **Do not export a custom score** unless a domain weight genuinely
differs (a warning that is near-fatal in your domain); then export
`score(artifact, issues) => 0-100` from `functions.js`. A score only informs
early termination — green is ALWAYS zero errors — and a crashing or
out-of-range score fails loud.

### Stage 4 — Classify inputs, outputs, reusables

- Materials: rendered into the prompt's `{{materials}}` slot. Separate by
  semantics via `materialsRoot`: `references` = project reference knowledge
  shared across work items; `input` = the user's per-work-item input document.
  Never mix the two.
- Upstream: hard dependency → `consumes` (tool-verified green receipts);
  optional background → rider (the caller passes it in `upstream`; your rules
  must tolerate absence) or explicit assumption registration.
- Artifacts: `scope: "topic"` (default; lands under `<topic>/output/`) vs
  `"workspace"` (project-level directory, ignores topic). `requiresTopic:
  true` pins one-work-item-per-topic. `artifactPrefix` hands per-fan-out-item
  naming to the engine (`<PREFIX>-<topicNo>-<NN>`).
- Reuse: defaults follow scope (workspace true / topic false). Declaring
  `reuse: true` on a topic pack requires every input class to be anchor-
  verifiable (materials manifest, upstream hashes, param drift policy).
  Action packs (merges, syncs) declare `reuse: false`.

### Stage 5 — Decompose into packs and design the chain

Pack boundary = artifact boundary, not business-stage boundary. Each pack
closes its own loop (generate → validate → repair).

- Chain: `consumes` declares the DAG. Fan-out is 1:N:N:N — one upstream
  array, downstream packs produce one artifact per entry, anchored by index
  and copied identity fields (cosmic: `targetIndex` + `funcId` +
  `desiredCfps`). Merge/back-flow actions are their own pack consuming two
  upstreams.
- Check what exists first: `doc_packs` may already cover the document type;
  org-specific tuning of an existing type = same-name packsDir override, not
  a fork. Chain-level shared params (numbering conventions, tree depth) are
  declared once at the chain head and inherited via receipts.

### Stage 6 — Design the params

Walk each candidate param through: type (scalar / object budget shape) →
`required` without default (ONLY for quantities that come exclusively from
user intent) vs a default (the standing value) → `confirm` (must pass the
confirmation gate) → `overridable` (materials may adjust; requires
`confirm`) → `extractable` (materials may self-prove via verbatim quote;
requires `confirm`; never on fan-out addressing params) → `enum`/`min`/`max`.

- **Mind the gap**: only the generation target (the object's `value`) enters
  the model-visible effective params; band endpoints are validation tolerance
  and live in rules and receipts. An endpoint that IS generation semantics
  becomes its own scalar param.
- Inherited params (re-declaring a chain-head param downstream) must NOT
  carry a default — receipt inheritance always wins; a default would be dead
  data.
- Params referenced by declarative-rule bounds or pattern sources must be
  always-present (default or required) and must NOT be `overridable`.
- Restraint: few params beat many; template-hardcoded "recommended values"
  must yield to params (the prompt says "per effective params").

### Stage 7 — Write the prompts and templates

One prompt per language. Skeleton (see `packs/cosmic-plan/prompts/`):
role/scene sentence → domain model section (**one pack, one vocabulary** —
only this stage's concepts) → output requirements (each field, where its
value comes from) → hard constraints (**the mirror of your rule set**) →
`{{materials}}`, `{{upstream}}`, `{{params}}` slots (missing `{{materials}}`
fails at load time).

Hard contract: hard constraints state only things rules can check, and cover
everything rules check. Bilingual packs: keep structure identical across
languages; only wording differs.

Template (Handlebars): renders the artifact for humans; follow the schema's
shape; no validation semantics.

### Stage 8 — Verify (the ladder, cheap to expensive)

1. **`pack:check -- <dir>`** (layers 1-2): loader gate + per-language golden
   green + health sheet. Run after every asset, fix reds immediately.
2. **Mutation tests** (repo lane): for every rule family, corrupt the golden
   sample deliberately, assert the checker catches it. In the repository this
   is enforced by the vitest suite — follow `tests/rules.spec.ts` patterns
   (one corruption per family; corrupt → validate → expect the rule id).
3. **Deterministic loop test** (repo lane): scripted LLM seam feeds broken
   JSON through `doc_generate`; assert the repair loop converges, the receipt
   fields (hashes, params, rounds) are correct, termination reasons are right.
4. **Host smoke** (repo lane): `pnpm run smoke:host` — the packed plugin must
   boot in a real dsh host with all tools registered (no model call).
5. **Real e2e** (both lanes): run the plugin against a real model.
   - CLI: create a dsh profile, point `packsDir` at your pack directory,
     boot `dsh --profile <name>` and drive a generation task with real
     materials; confirm the artifact + green receipt land under the output
     root.
   - dsh web: install/reload the plugin (restart so apply re-runs), then in a
     session drive the generation and OBSERVE: the confirmation gate presents
     the param table before the first generation (unless confirmPolicy is
     none), the repair loop converges, the receipt is green, reuse returns
     `reused: true` with zero model rounds on a second identical call, and
     `doc_chain_status` accounts for every fan-out item.
   A pack is not done because rules are green — it is done when a real model
   converges inside the loop you designed.

### Stage 9 — Register and document

- `version` starts at 0.1.0; any change to rule semantics bumps the version
  (old receipts become stale and chains re-generate — that is the point).
- `description`: bilingual (`{ "en": "...", "zh": "..." }`); the `en` line is
  what the model sees in `doc_packs` — state what the pack generates, what it
  consumes, and its granularity, in one sentence.
- Repository lane: feature branch, full gates (tests, coverage, typecheck,
  build), merge, README/manual section, changelog entry. packsDir lane: the
  health sheet from `pack:check` plus the real e2e observation log are the
  deliverable record.

## Final gate (every box checked)

- [ ] `pack:check` green on the pack directory (all languages)
- [ ] Every rule family has a mutation that is caught (repo lane: in the test suite)
- [ ] Prompt hard constraints mirror the rule set; slots present
- [ ] Params walk complete (no dead defaults; invariants hold — the loader verifies)
- [ ] required-no-default params covered by `golden.params.json` if rules read them
- [ ] Real-model e2e observed: gate → converge → green receipt (+ reuse + chain status for chained packs)
- [ ] Version, bilingual description, and the health sheet recorded
